JSamp is a simple sampling CPU profiler for the JVM, written in Java.  It works by periodically taking a snapshot of each thread's stack.

JSamp can be attached/detached arbitrarily to/from a running JVM.  It can also be programmatically started/stopped, from within the application itself, when used as a library.

See the [Documentation](Documentation.md) for more details.
